👋 I'm Lilla Pulay, a Front-end Developer living in the Netherlands. I started studying Web Development in early 2020 after deciding on changing careers from Law. 


⚙️ I’m currently working on improving my portfolio and some of my projects. You can visit me [here](http://lillapulay.dev).  
  

📖 I’m starting to learn some Computer Science basics. Even though I picked up some knowledge on it during my recent course, I want to really get into it.  
  

📧 You can get in touch with me by mailing me at pulaylilla@gmail.com. Feel free to say hi!  
  

🎓 I just turned in my last task for my Web Development bootcamp! I'm excited to take the next step on my learning journey and improve my existing projects and start building new ones soon.
